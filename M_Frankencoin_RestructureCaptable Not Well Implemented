Vulnerability details
Impact
RestructureCaptable is a function to use in case of disaster like scenario where there are less than 1000 zchf in equity left.
The idea of this function is for a small group of FPS holders to "save" the project.
But this function is malformed and would hurt a single user or revert in case he/she would not own enough amount of zchf

Proof of Concept
function restructureCapTable(address[] calldata helpers, address[] calldata addressesToWipe) public {
    require(zchf.equity() < MINIMUM_EQUITY);
    checkQualified(msg.sender, helpers);  // check 3%
    for (uint256 i = 0; i<addressesToWipe.length; i++){
        address current = addressesToWipe[0]; //@audit-issue replace to addressToWipe[i]
        _burn(current, balanceOf(current));
    }
}

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Replace the code

function restructureCapTable(address[] calldata helpers, address[] calldata addressesToWipe) public {
    require(zchf.equity() < MINIMUM_EQUITY);
    checkQualified(msg.sender, helpers);  // check 3%
    for (uint256 i = 0; i<addressesToWipe.length; i++){
+       address current = addressesToWipe[i]; 
-       address current = addressesToWipe[0];
        _burn(current, balanceOf(current));
    }
}
