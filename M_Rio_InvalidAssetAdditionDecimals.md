## An asset with less than 6 decimals can be added in supportedAssets due to missing related check.
## Summary
Protocol says that standard ERC20 tokens with no less than 6 decimals and no more than 18 decimals. However, the _addAsset function only checks whether an asset has more than 18 decimal places, but not more than 6 decimal places.

## Vulnerability Detail
Only checks if decimals is no more than 18, but not checks if decimals is no less than 6.

## Impact
An asset which is not preferred by protocol can be added due to missing checks.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
-   if (decimals > 18) revert INVALID_ASSET_DECIMALS();
-   if (decimals > 18 || decimals < 6) revert INVALID_ASSET_DECIMALS();
```
